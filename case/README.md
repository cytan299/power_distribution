This is the 3D case that I designed for the power distribution. The
source code for generating the case is written in
[OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org) and saved in *3D_case.scad*.

The file *3D_case.stl* file can be uploaded to [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com) for manufacture. The material that I used is

* Black Strong & Flexible.

# Front cover

The front cover is in *ponoko_front_cover2.svg*. This file can be
uploaded to [Ponoko](http://www.ponoko.com) for manufacture. The material that I used is

* Acrylic - Light Gray TINT
* 3.0 mm thick
* P2 - 384.0 mm long x 384.0 mm wide
