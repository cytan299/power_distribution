# Bill of Materials

I present the estimated cost for building *one* power distribution unit here
to be $385. This is the lower bound for the cost of one such device
because, in practise, it is not possible to just buy 1 screw :) or is
cost effective to build just one board
[OshPark](http://www.oshpark.com). Plus, I did not include
tax or cost of shipping. I would imagine that if people banded
together to build multiple copies of this device, the cost will get
closer to $385.
